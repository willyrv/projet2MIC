# Introduction to Hidden Markov Chains

The objective of this project is to do an introduction to HMM by doing simulations. First we will see some notions of probability theory and we will simulate some random variables. We will also see how we compute histograms and empirical distribution functions.
The language we will use is python. I'm assuming you have some basis on python, if it is not the case you can follow this [short introduction](https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures "python2 tutorial") for python2 or a translation of the same [introduction](https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths/tree/master "python3 tutorial") into python3.

Most of the code we will use here should work in both (python2 and python3) but I will use python3.

I recommend to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
